		@sfera.config type
			cc.sferalabs.sfera.drivers.iono_pi.IonoPi
		@sfera.config read_interval
			Interval, in milliseconds, between subsequent readings of analog inputs and 1-Wire devices. If the value is set below 2000 (i.e. less than 2 seconds) the specified interval is only applied to analog inputs; 1-Wire devices will be polled with a 2 seconds interval.
		@sfera.config analog_min_variation
			Minimun voltage variation to be measured on analog inputs, after an event has been triggered, for a new one to occur. Defaults to 0
		@sfera.config digital_debounce
			Time, in milliseconds, required for digital inputs to maintain a value, after a variation, before an event is triggered. Defaults to 0
		@sfera.config w1
			Set to true to enable and monitor Wiegand interface 1
		@sfera.config w2
			Set to true to enable and monitor Wiegand interface 2
		@sfera.config one_wire_bus
			Set to true to enable the 1-Wire bus interface and monitor the connected devices on TTL1
		@sfera.config one_wire_max
			Specify the TTL number(s) on which to enable the MaxDetect 1-Wire interface and monitor the connected devices. 
			E.g. set to 2 to monitor TTL2, set to [3, 4] to monitor TTL3 and TTL4.
